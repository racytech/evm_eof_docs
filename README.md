## EVM Object Foramt (EOF) 

### Structured Bytecode and Versioning (EIP-3540)

Legacy bytecode does not have any structure or any bytecode organization rules. Meaning that instractions in it can have any order. This makes it hard to analize and validate it. EOF organizes bytecode into clear structure. Following picture illustrates EOF version 1 structure.
